// * verification
If the backend programmers are responsible for sending the SMS, and you only need to write the API sync on the client-side to communicate with the backend for verification, you can follow these steps:

    Collect User Input: Update your sign-up screen to include a field where users can enter the verification code they received via SMS.

    Create an API Endpoint: Define an API endpoint on your server that the client-side can call to verify the entered verification code. This endpoint should accept the user's phone number and the verification code as input.

    Make an API Request: In your Flutter app, use the http package or any other HTTP client library to make a POST request to the verification endpoint on your server. Include the user's phone number and the entered verification code in the request payload.

dart

import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

Future<bool> verifyCode(String phoneNumber, String verificationCode) async {
  final url = Uri.parse('http://your-server-url.com/verify'); // Replace with your server's verification endpoint URL

  try {
    final response = await http.post(
      url,
      body: {
        'phoneNumber': phoneNumber,
        'verificationCode': verificationCode,
      },
    );

    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      final responseData = json.decode(response.body);
      final isVerified = responseData['isVerified'];
      return isVerified;
    } else {
      throw Exception('Verification failed with status code ${response.statusCode}');
    }
  } catch (e) {
    throw Exception('Error occurred during verification: $e');
  }
}

Replace 'http://your-server-url.com/verify' with the actual URL of your server's verification endpoint.

    Handle API Response: Process the API response received from the server in the Flutter app. In this example, the verifyCode function returns a boolean value indicating whether the verification was successful or not. You can use this information to allow or deny the user's sign-up based on the verification result.

    Perform Sign-Up: If the verification is successful (isVerified is true), proceed with the sign-up process and send the user's registration data to the server. You can use the same http.post method to make the sign-up request.

By following these steps, you can synchronize the client-side API request for verification with the backend's responsibility of sending the SMS and handling the verification logic.

Please note that the actual implementation details, including the server-side verification endpoint and logic, may depend on your specific backend infrastructure and programming language. Adjust the code accordingly to match your server-side implementation.
